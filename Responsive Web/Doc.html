        <p>UX design is Human Computer Interaction. <br>
          It is about -'How can we make the experience of interacting with a computer, a smartphone, a product, a
          service-intuitive, smooth and pleasant</p>
        <p>Methods and steps to follow are:</p>

          <p> Peter Morville’s seven subjective factors of user experience can help us define what makes an experience
            good. The product or service should be useful, usable, findable, credible, desirable, accessible and
            valuable. What is valuable differs greatly between products, customers and businesses</p>
          <p>As a user experience designer, you should prioritize your product users and aim to deliver value to product
            owners (e.g., business owners, non-profits, key stakeholders).</p>

          <p><i> Don Norman, director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego, first coined the term
              “user-centered design” in 1993. </i></p>
          <p>In human-centered design, a designer conducts user research and digs beneath the surface of problems to
            identify and design solutions based on the root cause(s). When looking at the problem, the team must look at
            it holistically, as a system with several interconnected parts. Be aware that any changes to one part will
            impact other parts. This is why design teams are usually multi-disciplinary. The more diverse the team's
            background and expertise, the more likely the team will be able to see different perspectives and frame
            accurate requirements.</p>

          <p>Google’s Design Sprint borrows from the design thinking methodology and the culture of hackathons, and
            packages the design process into a five-day process. The design sprint has been tried, tested and refined by
            teams in several Google and Google-backed products including Gmail, 23andme, Nest and Slack. </p>

          <p>The five days of the sprint look like this:

          <ul>
            <li>Visibility of system status: Keep the user informed about what is happening behind the scenes.</li>
            <li>Match between system and the real world: Ensure the conventions you use match what the user is already
              familiar with in the real world.</li>
            <li>User control and freedom: Allow users to step back, undo and redo their actions.</li>
            <li>Consistency and standards: Ensure interface elements like labels and icons behave consistently
              throughout the product.</li>
            <li>Error prevention: Anticipate, and plan for errors. Where possible, eliminate them; and for other cases,
              ensure users can easily recover from errors.</li>
            <li>Recognition rather than recall: Do not expect users to remember or recall information. It is always
              easier to recall information when we have clues to point us towards it. For example, it is easier for us
              to pick (i.e., recognize) the right answer from a list of options, rather than attempting to answer from
              memory (recall). Make sure your interface has cues to help users recognize information.</li>
            <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use: Allow users to customize or tailor the interface to suit their needs
              so that they can perform frequent actions more easily.</li>
            <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design: Remove clutter and any superfluous information so that users can focus
              on achieving their goal, instead of getting confused or overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: Avoid technical jargon. Write error messages in
              plain language and ensure nothing gets lost in translation.</li>
            <li>Help and documentation: Provide easily accessible and searchable documentation.

          <p>Pros of Heuristic Evaluation
          <ul>
            <li>Heuristics can help highlight potential usability issues early in the design process.</li>
            <li>It is a fast and inexpensive tool compared with other methods involving real users.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cons of Heuristic Evaluation
          <ul>
            <li>Heuristic evaluation depends on the knowledge and expertise of the evaluators. Training the evaluators
              or hiring external evaluators might increase the time and money required for conducting the evaluation.
            </li>

            <li>Heuristic evaluation is based on assumptions about what “good” usability is. As heuristics are based on
              research, this is often true. However, the evaluations are no substitute for testing with real users.
              These are, as the name suggests, only guidelines, and not rules that are set in stone.</li>

            <li>Heuristic evaluation can end up giving false alarms. In their article, “Usability testing vs. heuristic
              evaluation: A head-to-head comparison,” Robert Bailey, Robert Allan and P. Raiello found that 43% of
              'problems' identified by experimental heuristic evaluations were not actually problems. Furthermore,
              evaluators could only identify 21% of genuine usability problems in comparison with usability testing.
